# Web-Scraping-for-Car-Data
   Repository to store code and research done for the Thesis: Data Scraping and Analysis of Used Car Sales Data for Battery Electric Vehicles in Australia.

# Repository Structure
## 1. Data Analysis
This folder contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed for data analysis, focusing on vehicle depreciation, mileage trends, and fuel types.

#### DriveFuelType.py: 
This Python script categorizes cars based on their fuel type using the data collected from various web sources.

### Depreciation Analysis
Focuses on analyzing how different car models depreciate over time, with specific attention to MSRP (Manufacturerâ€™s Suggested Retail Price) and data from Drive.com.

#### Drive.com Data.xlsx: 
Contains raw listing data from Drive.com, used as a basis for further depreciation analysis.

#### Listings.xlsx: Another dataset focused on car listings.

### MSRP Depreciation:

#### DepreciationAnalysis.ipynb: 
Jupyter notebook analyzing how cars depreciate relative to their MSRP over time. It includes statistical analysis and visualizations to illustrate trends.
#### GetMergedData.ipynb: 
Merges various datasets for unified analysis, focusing on MSRP and listing prices.
#### RetentionRateAnalysis.ipynb: 
Explores retention rates across different car models, providing insights into how long cars hold their value.
#### StatisticsSummary.ipynb: 
Summarises key statistics of the collected datasets, providing an overview of the major trends.
### Electric Ranges:
#### CarDetailsFromShowroom.py: 
Scrapes car details from showroom links to gather electric vehicle (EV) range data.
#### DriveShowroomScraper.py: 
A web scraper to extract data from Drive.com's showroom pages specifically related to electric cars.
#### ElectricVehiclesInfoFromShowroomLinks.xlsx: 
Dataset containing details on EVs collected from the showroom.
#### RangeAnalysis.ipynb: 
Analyses the ranges of electric vehicles, comparing the data gathered through scraping to real-world performance.

### MileageAnalysis.ipynb: Detailed notebook that analyzes mileage trends across different vehicle models and categories.
## 2. Web Scraping
Contains Python scripts used for web scraping from car-related websites.

#### CarsGuideScraping.py: 
Scrapes car data from CarsGuide, focusing on vehicle specifications and listings.
#### DriveScraping.py:
Scrapes car data from Drive.com, used for the depreciation and listing analysis.
